1. Emmet is responsible for genrating some code for us..
2. Browsers have in-built js engines to understand the javascript code
   but browser does not know what is react.
3. CDN Links for React JS : They are the content delivery network, these are websites where react js is hoisted
   & we are pulling react from there.

   -> What is CDN & Why do we use it. ?
   -> What is cross origin ? 

4. After importing the CDM react link, now our project & browser both can understand react.js
   Open the file in browser, open on console tab -> simply type React (will see the resp..)

5. The react-dom is the bridge b/w react & dom.

In git ignore,
- we put node_modules.
- we don't put package, pacjage-lock.json file..
*. If we package, pacjage-lock.json, we can easily re-create node_modules..
*. Whatever we can re-generate on server don't put it in git..

- npx parcel build <index.html>
